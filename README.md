### Importance of Design Properties Identification

Identifying design properties from a mockup is crucial for several reasons:

1. **Consistency**: Establishing a cohesive visual language ensures the application feels unified and professional across all screens and components.

2. **Development Efficiency**: When developers have clear specifications for colors, typography, and spacing, they can implement designs more accurately and quickly.

3. **Accessibility**: Identifying proper color contrasts and text sizes helps ensure the application meets WCAG guidelines and is usable for all users.

4. **Scalability**: A well-documented design system makes it easier to extend the application with new features while maintaining visual consistency.

5. **Brand Identity**: Consistent use of colors, typography, and design patterns strengthens brand recognition and user trust.

6. **Responsive Design Planning**: Understanding the design system helps in adapting layouts appropriately across different screen sizes and devices.

7. **Handoff Clarity**: Clear design specifications reduce miscommunication between designers and developers, resulting in fewer revisions.
